<span style="color:#c0392b;"><b>Issue </b><br>
In this article we would learn to use a anchor tag with a webpage and can share it with customers so that they do not have to scan through the page.<br>
While sharing a documentation we can share the modified link to the customer so that it becomes easier for the customer to browse through the page and saves their time.<br>
<b>Environment</b><br>
All<br>
<b>Cause </b><br>
Browsing through pages is time consuming and confusing.<br>
We can share the anchored link to the customer so that they can directly visit the desired part of the page.<br>
&#160;<br>
<b>Resolution </b><br>
Suppose we are sharing a link and ask the customer to visit a the part where it say Define Control Groups:<br>
<br>
https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/AC6.1/en/CMP_Marketing_campaigns_Setting_up_marketing_campaigns.html<br>
<br>
It would be very confusing and time consuming for the customer to find the part of the page where the customer has to see through the page.<br>
<br>
The best way to save time is share the anchored link:<br>
<br>
https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/AC6.1/en/CMP_Marketing_campaigns_Setting_up_marketing_campaigns.html#Defining_a_control_group<br>
<br>
This way customer can directly jump to the particular part of the page.<br>
